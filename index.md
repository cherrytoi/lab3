find-results.txt
```

The "more" command is used to display the text files in the command one screen at a time. The -9 expresses the number of lines I want to display per screen. It is useful because you can navigate the commands by scrolling up and down, a convenient method to access the terminal.

The command "head"
```
docsearch-main head find-results.txt
written_2/
written_2//non-fiction
written_2//non-fiction/OUP
written_2//non-fiction/OUP/Berk
written_2//non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch2.txt
written_2//non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch1.txt
written_2//non-fiction/OUP/Berk/CH4.txt
written_2//non-fiction/OUP/Berk/ch7.txt
written_2//non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy
written_2//non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch2.txt
```
```
 docsearch-main head -n 3 find-results.txt
written_2/
written_2//non-fiction
written_2//non-fiction/OUP
```

The "head" command displays the first 10 lines in a file. It is useful for extracting a specific number of lines at the beginning of a file; the -n 3 portion showcases the first 3 lines, which correlates to the "3" I inputted.

written_2//travel_guides/berlitz2/Cancun-WhereToGo.txt
```
The "tail" command displays the last 10 lines in a file, very similar to "head" which displayed the first 10 lines. It is useful for extracting a specific number of lines at the end of a file; the -n 8 portion showcases the last 8 lines, which correlates to the "8" I inputted.

written_2//non-fiction/OUP/Castro/chY.txt
written_2//non-fiction/OUP/Castro/chO.txt
written_2//travel_guides
```



The sed command has a lot of functionalities, with one of them essentially providing a similar service as less does, but instead it displays specific lines of a file depending on what the boundaries set by the numbers in the single quotation marks.
